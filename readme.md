## FLEXSHIELD v1

<img src="./assets/images/olc-flexshield-full.jpg" alt="Full face variant" style="max-width:50%" >

This is a disposable and/or reusable face shield design, it's currently in the early stages of review by our local hospitals and this iteration addresses a couple of issues from our previous design.

1) Integrated shield cover now extends coverage over the front of the top of the head.

2) Fully sanitisable materials in Isopropyl alcohol - specifically no foam or adhesive parts are required that would be degraded by washing/sanitising

3) Split the design into a Full Face version that wraps over the top of the head for more protection and a standard version that simply wraps around the face and can be produced in larger quantities.

**Note that this is not an approved medical or protective device and has not been tested or certified as fit for any restricted use.**
